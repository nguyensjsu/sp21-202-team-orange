# Summary
Our project is a multiplayer turn based shooting game where 2 players try to hit each other with a physics projectile. This idea came about due to the recent EOLing of adobe flash player. Many of us had grown up playing adobe flash games with very similar premises - and with Flash's EOL just passed, we wanted to create a tribute to those somewhat crude 2D physics games of our childhoods. With that in mind, we included many hallmarks of that particular genre of game - stock art backgrounds, inconsistent sprite choices, and simplistic gameplay mechanics. While perhaps not as involved as we had originally intended, we believe our project reflects that experience rather well.

With regards to the physics: the projectile's movement speed and direction depends on the location of the mouse, the further away the mouse is from the player, the faster it will go. Players have a set amount of distance they can travel (energy) in a turn and uses the a and d key on the keyboard to move left and right respectively. The goal of this is to make it harder for the enemy to use the same shot on you two turns in a row. Players would take turns shooting the projectile and when their respective hp goes down to 0, the opponent will win the game. The game will then restart after a few moments.
